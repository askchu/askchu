### Hi there 👋

I'm an inspiring self-taught web developer eager to learn new languages and design responsive interactive websites.
Follow my journey as I learn to code and become a developer!

I'm currently learning NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, React, Bootstrap, SQL and NoSQL.

My current technical projects include:
   1) Hangry App (Web Application)
       -> Allow users to search for restaurants and the option for the app to choose for them if he/she still can't decide.
       -> Includes a map display of the restaurants fetched and general location of the user's address.
       -> User's are able to save specific restaurants into their favourites list to narrow down their search.
